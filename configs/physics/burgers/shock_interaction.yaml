# Burgers' Equation - Shock Interaction (Multiple Pulses)
# Demonstrates faster (taller) shocks overtaking slower (shorter) ones
# Key phenomenon: shock merging as higher amplitude waves catch up
preset: burgers
parameters:
  epsilon: 0.03      # low viscosity for sharp shock fronts

init:
  type: multi-pulse
  params:
    # Taller pulses behind shorter ones - taller travels faster
    positions: [0.1, 0.25, 0.4]     # normalized x positions (left to right)
    amplitudes: [2.5, 1.5, 0.8]     # decreasing amplitudes (tall catches short)
    width: 0.04                      # narrow pulses
